         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Declaration of the two King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doms of England and Scotland have produced ſome effects in gi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving time to thoſe who have ſtept out of the way to come in by the firſt of March, as appeareth by Sir Edw. Deering, Mr. Murry and orhers, who ſubmitting themſelves to the mercie of the Parliament accordingly doe receive the benefit of the Declaration. And no doubt there will bee many more here before that time, in the mean time heae is preſented a Declaration of what hath proceeded againſt Sir Edward Deering.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154575:3"/>
            <p> WHereas Malignants, and ſome evill diſpoſed people have cenſured this returne from Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to the Parliament, to be either becauſe to be prickt Sheriff of Kent by the King could not be obtained, nor yet the Deanerie of Canterburie, and laſt of all to be turned out of the Parliament at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; it is nothing but the malice of the envious brood that faigns theſe falſe calumnies to blemiſh by unjuſt reports.</p>
            <p>The true reaſon of this return from that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Armie, (unfortunate indeed, by miſleading juſt intentions, to walk out of the way) are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That becauſe it was ſo cleerlie manifeſt, that whatſoever reſolutions or advice the Nobilitie and Gentrie had taken and given to his Majeſtie to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he from time to time was led the contrarie way by a ſecret Juncto of Popiſhlie affected councels, who continually croſſed the deſignes of the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate partie about the King.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For adviſing his Majeſtie to ſhew ſome marke of disfavour upon the papiſts, and not to put them in truſt in places of ſuch concernment, as he doth, but found no acceptance.</p>
            <p n="3">3 For declaring plainly at Oxford how to take up arms under the Earle of Eſſex was better grounded upon better reaſon, for ſatisfaction of conſcience: then to take up arms againſt the Parliament, and to join with the papiſts &amp; Prelats in their Cavalrie.</p>
            <p n="4">4 For ſaying at Oxford before the ſitting of the Junctos. That if they offered to ſit there as a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. that it were juſt with God to throw ſome judgement down upon them.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Deering,</hi> conſidering the wayes of the enemie, as is expreſt in the Declaration, laid downe his Commiſſion in November laſt.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154575:3"/>
            <p> On Wedneſday, Februarie the ſeventh, Sir <hi>Edward Deering</hi> preſented an humble petition to the Houſe of Commons. For everie one that comes in by vertue of the aforeſaid Declaration, muſt petition the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thereby claimed what is promiſed by the ſame.</p>
            <p n="1">1 SIr <hi>Edward Deering</hi> did acknowledge it a great weakneſſe in him, that he had deſerted the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: and leave that juſt and legall way which he was in with them to joine with the wicked proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the enemie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That hee is fully convinſed that the Enemie ſeeks all poſſible waies to deſtroy the libertie of the Subject involved in Parliaments.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That he hath bin much troubled in conſcience, for that he having formerly taken the Proteſtation to maintain and defend this Parliament, hath bin ſo far deluded to appear in arms againſt it, and could not be in quiet untill he had returned.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That although hee will not taxe his Majeſtie with breach of promiſe, yet he ſees there is a deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſomewhere, ſince the Papiſts are not onely in Armes againſt the Parliament, but in chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Kings Armie.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That the preferring of Papiſts before Proteſtants in the Kings A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mie, hath been a great griefe to him to ſee.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That whereas there he ſee them about to affront the Parliament, by forging a pretended one at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, which proceedings were cleane againſt his apro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, he was exceedingly deſirous to leave them.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That hee thought it a great happineſſe to ſee the Declaration publiſhed, the benefit whereof hee was now returned to claim.</p>
            <p>And accordinglie he took the Covenant, and is at libertie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154575:4"/>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas there are twenty thouſand Scots already in England, &amp; there are twelve thouſand more muſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Scotland; they have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy poſſeſſeſt themſelves of all the Faſt part of Northumberland and the Forts and Caſtles betweene Barwicke and Tinmouth. They have taken the Iſle of Cocket: and the Garriſon thereof, with ſeventy Commanders and other common Souldiers: ſeven peeces of Ordnance, and all their ammunition, and have placed a Garriſon of their owne men therein.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of that Countie come into them daily, and the more becauſe the Gentrie of the Countrie join with them and take the Covenant, ſo that indeed all Northumberland is prettie well redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the obedience of the King, and Parliament; Newcaſtle, Tinmouth, and the Sheelds only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which it is verie probable by this time are in their hands too, eſpecially Newcaſtle.</p>
            <p>The Scots lie quattered about Morpeth, Seaton, Hepam: Ogle Caſtle, Prude, and thoſe parts about Newcaſtle: and have laid a ſtrong ſiege about New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle alſo: and ly cloſe under the verie Walls, the Malignants are for the moſt part all of them gone into Newcaſtle, when they firſt heard of the Scots approach, whether they carried ſuch treaſure and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goods as they moſt eſteemed: There is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie whether Generall King be in Newcaſtle or not, but the Scots had beſieged it eight days: which is to this time above a fortnight: There are a great number in the Town; but they wiſh that all New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtles Army was there, that they might make ſhort work with them, for they did not expect the taking of Newcaſtle to be much troubleſome to them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154575:4"/>
            <p> Generall Leſley ſent a Meſſenger to the Towne to the Governour thereof: to require the delivery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to him: for the uſe of the King, and Parliament, and that for their ſo doing, the Town ſhould be free from plunder, and themſelves in perſon ſecured; with other propoſitions as was by the Generall thought f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t.</p>
            <p>The Meſſenger having delivered his Meſſage to Col. Glenham, who received it in the name of the Town, the Town was ſummoned, and a parlie was held concerning the ſame, and it was agreed upon, that an anſwer ſhould be returned to Generll Leſley: to deſire him only to grant five daies reſpite, and then a full anſwer ſhould be given him.</p>
            <p>This anſwer being brought to Generall Leſley he was very willing to condiſcend thereunto, and the more rather becauſe hee had not then his murthering pieces ready, by reaſon the ilneſſe of the wayes hindred them, but by that time (at the fartheſt) he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them, reſolving that if they would not deliver up the Town the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y would ſtorme it, but it was then believed by the Scots Armie that it would be ſurrendred to them, ſo that there is no queſtion but that by this time it is in their hands.</p>
            <p>And as for the Shields they are not yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but being only but houſes they doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that it will bee no great matter to take them, they can doe it when they liſt, The
<pb facs="tcp:154575:5"/>greateſt matter next unto the taking of New caſtle Town, is Tinmouth Caſtle.</p>
            <p>They are not yet over Tyne, but in caſe they are forced by any occaſion to ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Newcaſtle they in end to leave a ſtrong ſiege there and to march into the Biſhoprick of Durham.</p>
            <p>They doe carry themſelves ſo ſivelly and orderly that the Countrey doe even admire them, taking not the worth of a penny from any man but what they pay fully for, and they are not come unprovided, for every ſouldier hath 2 or 3 peeces in his pocket, and there hath thouſands come in to them, and taken the Covenant, and their Army doth exceedingly in creaſe.</p>
            <p>The Ships that were laden in the channel with malignants goods, were ſtopt in by 4 Parliament Ships which the vice Admirall appointed to ly before Tinmouth, but the laſt weeke about Thuaſday and Friday there fell ſuch ſtormes that our ſhips could not ride there, but were forced to ſale away from thence for fear of being ſhipwrackt, at which time they took their oportunity, and ſaled out of the channell, and have carried away their fraught, it is ſuppoſed for Holland.</p>
